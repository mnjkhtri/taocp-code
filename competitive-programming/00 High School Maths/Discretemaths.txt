1. Binomial numbers:
    (n,k) : numbers of subsets of size k from a set of n

    Properties: 

    (n,k) = n!/k!(n-k)! [expensive calculation]

    Total subsets in a set of n = 2^n

    No of subsets of size k from a set of n = No of subsets of size n-k from the set of n

    No of subsets of size k from a set of n = (n/k) * No of subsets of size k-1 from the set of n-1

    No of subsets of size k from a set of n + No of subsets of size k+1 from the set of n
        =No of subsets of size k+1 from a set of size n+1 


2. Probability:
    X = maps probabilty space onto numeric values

    [same space]
    P(A') = 1 - P(A)
    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 
    P(A and B) = P(A) P(B given A) = P(B) P(A given B)

    
    E(X) = S xPr(X=x)
