# Quantum

Deutsch's Algorithm
quickly determine if a black box is either completely constant or perfectly balanced, using just one query to the box. 

Jozsa's Algorithm
An extension of the Deutsch problem.

Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm
can uncover a hidden binary code by asking a quantum oracle just one question

Simon's Algorithm
can crack cryptographic secrets faster than classical computers

Shor's Algorithm (real deal)
can factor large numbers into their prime components efficiently

Grover's Algorithm
can help find the right answer in an unsorted database faster than classical methods.
