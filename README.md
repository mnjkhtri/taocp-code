This is the dump of random code (actual goldmine) I wrote during undergrad:

(in no particular order)

1. the-art-of-computer-programming: implementing the algorithms from
[taocp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) in C++

2. ultimate-tic-tac-toe: simple search bots to play 9x9 tictactoe

3. numerical-algorithms: primitive numerical algorithms in C++

4. opengl: [this](https://learnopengl.com/)

5. brain-tumor-detection-and-localization: kaggle style training and inference

6. riscv-core: verilog was cool back then, riscv is still cool. implements non-pipeline functional ricsv instruction set for fpga

7. qubits-qiskit: did some qiskit upto Shor's factoring

8. atcoder-educational-dp: solving [this](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks)

9. optimizer-dgemm: a series of C++ optimizationt to match the speed of numpy

10. competitive-programming: templates and standard problems from codeforces and leetcode

11. satisfiability-and-cousins: everything is a SAT problem
